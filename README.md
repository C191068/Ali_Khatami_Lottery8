### Deploying the Lottery contract 

It is almost imposiible to write a smart contract without making a mistake <br>

here we create a new folder <br>

at our code at here https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Lottery7.git <br>
at constructor we see a ton of parameter <br>

We can see in the constructor we are interacting with contract vrfCoordinatorV2 <br>

As in the parameter vrfCoordinatorV2 is the address of the contract <br>

we probably  need to deploy  some mock for this <br>

Since it is the contract that we want to interact which is outside of our project <br>

here by opening this file we gonna deploy our lottery contract <br>
